# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## My Goal

In this I will be diving into more Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this module, I should be comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.


## What I will create

I am going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let me unleash my musical talent where ever I am.
